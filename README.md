# Smart Waste Bin Monitoring System

This project presents a conceptual IoT-based Smart Waste Bin Monitoring System
designed to improve urban waste collection efficiency.

## Objective
To monitor waste bin fill levels in real time and optimize garbage collection routes
using IoT technology.

## System Overview
- Ultrasonic sensors measure waste levels in bins
- ESP32 microcontroller processes sensor data
- Data is sent to the cloud using MQTT protocol
- Authorities monitor bins using a dashboard
- Collection routes are optimized based on bin priority

## Note
This is a virtual IoT design project created for an academic assessment.
